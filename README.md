### Object oriented programming 2 (OBJ2000)

This is a repo consisting of the programs as featured in the course book _Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures_ by _Y. Daniel Liang_. As per usual the "during-chapter" programs will be found with descriptive file names and the "after-chapter" programming exercises, referred to as "section" in the course book will be featured in the list beneath the __Objectives__-list with descriptive names and hyperlinks to its respective GitHub URL instead.

---

__Objectives__
> - To write programs for executing statements repeatedly using a `while` loop
> - To write loops for the guessing number problem
> - To follow the loop design strategy to develop loops
> - To control a loop with the user confirmation or a sentinel value
> - To obtain large input from a file using input redirection rather than typing from the keyboard
> - To write loops using `do-while` statements
> - To write loops using `for` statements
> - To discover the similarities and differences of three types of loop statements
> - To write nested loops
> - To learn the techniques for minimizing numerical errors
> - To learn loops from a variety of examples (`GCD`,`FutureTuition` and `Dec2Hex`).
> - To implement program control with `break` and `continue`.
> - To process characters in a string using a loop in a case study for palindrome
> - To write a program that displays prime numbers

#### Section classes

The __section__ classes are programming exercises. These come after each chapter instead of during the chapters as the __listing__ classes does. `*` and `**`denotes heightened difficulty according the course book editors.
